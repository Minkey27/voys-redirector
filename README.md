# Freedom and VoIPGRID links redirect chrome extension
This is a Chrome extension that detects when you are trying to access partner.voipgrid.nl or freedom.voys.nl and redirects you to the other as per a configurable setting.

## ChatGPT
This extension was created as a proof of concept with chatGPT to see how powerful chatGPT was and to satisfy a personal itch.

## Installation
It is not intended for this extension to end up in the chrome extension store as this is meant as an internal extension.
You can download this repository as a .zip and manually load it into your chrome extensions.

1. Download this repository as a zip.
2. Unpack the .zip somewhere safe. You do need to keep the files so the extension can work!
3. Go to your chrome extensions (chrome://extensions/)
4. Enable developer mode in the top-right.
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top-left.
6. Select your unpacked folder. Congratulations you've added the extension!
7. Click on the extension and configure the redirect directions (Voys -> VoIPGRID / VoIPGRID -> Voys). The default is VoIPGRID to Voys.

## Note
Since this extension is being installed manually, it will not receive any updates and any updates will have to be applied manually by yourself.
